arc based dark-dracula theme for linux desktop environment.
A theme based on arc with dark and green color combination for linux desktop environment. It is an arc based theme that i have twicked using oomox theme customizer. I have used this to my xfce desktop environment . I don't know if it'll work with other or not use install it with your own risk.

#Installing theme //just clone the repository and paste the whole cloned folder into your ~/.themes folder or /usr/share/themes folder. //Now go to your theme selecter application gui or cli. //that's it . You have done a very complecated job lol.
